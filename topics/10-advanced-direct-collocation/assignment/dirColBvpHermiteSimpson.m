% soln = dirColBvpHermiteSimpson(problem)
%
% This function computes the solution to a simple trajectory optimization
% problem using the Hermite--Simpson method for direct collocation.

% minimize: J = integral(pathObj(t, x, u))

% subject to:

%       dynamics:  dx = dynamics(t, x, u)
%
%       boundary constraints:  [c, ceq] = bndCst(x0, xF)
%
% given: time grid and initialization for state and control
