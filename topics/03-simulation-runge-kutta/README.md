# Topic 03: Fancy Simulation

Learn about medium-order Runge--Kutta integration methods: Midpoint method, Heun's method, The 4th-order Runge-Kutta method, and finally ode45.
Continue learning about how to implement these simulations in Matlab.

## Lecture One:
- live Matlab coding demo: simulate a pendulum
- introduction to second-order methods:
  - Heun's method
  - Midpoint method
- derivation of second-order explicit Runge-Kutta methods

## Lecture Two:
- Runge--Kutta methods in general
  - Butcher Table
  - Explicit vs. Implicit schemes
- The forth-order Runge--Kutta method
- Adaptive methods
- ode45, ode23, and ode15s
  - when to use each one and why?
  - where will each method fail?
  - how do they work?

## Lecture Two:
4th-order Runge--Kutta
ode45
accuracy and stability

## Homework:

In this assignment you will implement several different functions for simulation and then create plots comparing their accuracy for a few different simulations.
